      "Original Text: i once loved these chips and they were the only chips i would buy i discovered them when i was in england back in 2000 and quickly became a fan about a year ago i picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket i was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it after opening the bag i found the chips were not even close to the kettle chips i was used to they were all uniform whitish yellow in color flavor was way off the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and i was very disappointed so i e mailed kettle with the following what happened i bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste it tastes cheaper i do not know how else to put it i also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as i did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor i am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product did i just get a weird batch i have been buying only kettle chips for about 10 years now so i am wondering i did receive a reply thanks for letting us know about your experience with your kettle brand chips it sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections and we apologize our potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in color but our chips should still taste great thanks for providing us with the best before code from the bag this really helps when passing on your comments to our staff br we are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our kettle brand flavors or nut butters believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase in case you buy this product again we suggest avoiding the same best before date if you still have it in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspections at the same time br thanks again for letting us know about this and expect the coupons to arrive within 3 weeks please let me know if i can be of any more help well the next bag was good since that time i have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the bad bag so i am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost i did some research and found out that kettle was bought out by a private equity company so the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at kettle acquire company with high quality brand recognition sell product to mass merchants lower quality cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand stay away from kettle chips they are no longer the same\n",

      "Original Text: as another reviewer stated many of the reviews for this product are actually for a different raw cacao powder from alive and aware ecuadorian criollo raw cacao powder that is what i ordered about 3 months ago and it was awesome i am almost out and when i went to reorder my amazon account directed me to this product from saquin which is not what i ordered and it is more expensive the same base price but i got it with free shipping not 15 bucks so that is a big price increase i know it was still from alive and aware mid february but recently something changed br i am really confused irritated how my review for alive and aware raw cacao got switched to a different brand from a different seller i mean cannot they just say out of stock or currently unavailable like they do with other stuff why would they switch reviews around br seems very underhanded to transfer reviews from a different product to a newer one especially since as the other reviewer stated they are not comparable and this stuff from saquin is terrible compared to what we were getting from alive and aware also the price increase is pretty shocking i guess it is the market and raw cacao is in higher demand too bad that was such an awesome price for really awesome cacao br i did recently order alive and aware s raw criollo cacao nibs and i highly recommend those they are as the description states from alive and aware not another brand br frankly i am beginning to wonder about some of the brands and vendors that ship from amazon i know they have warehouses in different parts of the country but it is a little suspicious and i just wish there was more transparency about what comes from amazon and what comes from a different company seems like halal everyday alive and aware etc are almost interchangable since amazon took the liberty to take reviews from alive and aware and post them to halaleveryday saquin are these really different companies under the auspices of amazon or is it amazon by a different name only like the other reviewer said he ordered something that said alive and aware in the description and when it came it was from saquin halal everyday who knows i just want some more transparency so i can have more trust when ordering from amazon br br for now i am going to seek out another source not through amazon that stands behind their cacao it is very important to me for health benefits and the ecological social impacts of where it is harvested to know that i am getting top notch certified organic raw cacao if amazon is going to be so wishy washy and sneaky i am going elsewhere wagging finger at amazon br br i think for now i will leave the following review for alive and aware in case they do bring it back br br heavens to besty this stuff rocks it is such a good value too maybe the best out there as i have def shopped around i have tried a few different brands of raw organic cacao powder and this is certainly top notch kudos to alive and aware for offering it at such a reasonable price br i am not a raw foodie per say but i try to follow a neo paleo protocol which includes super foods such as raw cacao properly prepared with just enough natural sweetener i think this is a truly guilt free pleasure it is loaded with antioxidants as you probably know so go ahead get the big bag you can then share it with friends and family and turn them on to this super groovy super food of the gods theobroma as they say br my favorite way to consume it is actually as not so hot cocoa i just whisk it into gently heated fresh raw whole milk or cream so it is not too hot and to preserve as much nutrients as possible i know it is not 100 raw but hey this is how i love it add just enough sweetener i like sorghum molasses a scant t spoon a bit of maca powder a dash of real salt and after that is thoroughly whisked i top it off with a spoonful of evo coconut oil yumm i have converted everyone even the kids i babysit who used to prefer swiss miss or i make a concentrated warm cocoa beverage sans maca and coconut oil and then stir it into my raw milk for a half gallon of raw chocolate milk lightly sweetened you better believe it goes fast i love my family to get their good old fashioned grass fed animal fats with bioavailable vitamins a d and the x factor read weston a price and loads of antioxidants from the cacao to boot plus cacao activates the seratonin receptors and sorry i am bit fuzzy but you know it makes you feel good and happy br also process it with evo coconut oil and sweetener such as sorghum or honey or maple syrup in your cuisinart for heavenly truffles refrigerate for proper texture due to coconut oil i often toss in soaked dried nuts and dried unsulfured fruit and shredded coconut for healthy truffle energy bars just process in batches so it is kind of homogenous like those lara bars but cheaper and no packaging and even organic or raw br go for it buy this huge bag share the goodness and you will be healthier and happier for it i guarantee peace be with you\n",

      "Original Text: raw cacao powder differs greatly in taste than processed cacao powder commercial cacao powder is often triple fermented and then roasted commercial companies are more interested in a product which has no nutritional value but great consistency in flavor commercial cacao powder is mono tonal in flavor raw cacao is everything that commercial cacao is not it is a antioxidant super food which has no equal the taste does vary slightly from one part of the year to the next as to taste it has a wonderful intoxicating tannin like aroma with mild overtones of mahogany in foods it has a complexity which some cooks will absolutely love while the others who read from the book may want to go back to there standard one dimensional cacao in baking i believe it goes well with other flavors such as almond extract if you want to do an extraordinary butter cream icing with a tad of almond extract your icing will have no equal in chocolate cake i personally would go heavy and do a buttermilk or sour cream cake the acid helps to unify and amplify flavors i like making cake with 60 cake flour which is about has about 5 wheat gluten and 40 rice flour the reason for this should be obvious the heavy texture that rice flour imparts makes your cake stand proud and one bite is then never more than enough br br raw cocoa powder is rich in polyphenols such as catechins and procyanidins and has been shown to inhibit low density lipoprotein ldl oxidation and atherogenesis in a variety of models human studies have also shown daily intake of cocoa increases plasma high density lipoprotein hdl and decreases ldl levels although the drug companies having endeavored to understand the mechanism in which this happens\n",

      "Original Text: i have a now 8 month old male shih tzu when i brought him home from the breeder i kept him on the  pro plan puppy  tiny dry kibble until the bag was almost finished there was about 2 cups left in the bag and he began walking away from his bowl as soon as i put it down as a test i rolled a few morsels across the tile floor in the kitchen to see what would happen he would eat about 10 pieces and go bring me one of his squeaker toys to play with which i was happy with as i do not want to  play  with his food as a game to get him to eat i went and got him blue buffalo dry puppy food lamb and oatmeal formula which had bigger size kibbles it seemed that he liked the bigger sized items to chew on and the harder antioxidant bits since he was teething and chewing on his dentabones venison antler lamb lung chips for comfort again when i got down to about a quarter of food left in the bag he would walk away from the bowl this went on for almost 3 days he was still having small bowel movements urinating drinking water and playing running and continuing his successful training exercises called the vet and they wanted to give me wet venison formula by science diet veterinarian s diet after the exam which showed nothing physically wrong the one vet tech said that shih tzu s tend to be picky eaters i did not pick up the food at their check out counter left and began some of my own research into the breed itself and a more natural diet i know from some of our outdoor excursions that he is attracted to road kill he will sniff the air and want to lunge for it and would probably eat it if left to his own devices but i will not allow it i remember being a kid in the late 60 s early 70 s and all my friends who had dogs fed them 1 of 2 choices available back then gravy train or alpo and they mixed meat or the drippings from the meat they ate bones etc and all lived into their late teens one of my friends small mutt lived to be 24 years old i never saw these dogs itching or digging at themselves other than the usual ears or if their was a flea problem since i grew up in a rural area and most often that was a common occurrance well i read up on the more natural diets and decided to get the sojos and ground beef and some boneless chicken thighs breasts my weston is not a big fan of totally raw meat but when browned i put it in the toaster oven and add 1 4 tsp of  missing link  to the meat portion with the soaked sojos original he eats with gusto from his early days i would play with and take his food away so he is not food aggressive he eats the recommended portion for his size and walks away when done weston then wants to play hard train hard take a nice walk and nap his coat is soft and easy to keep brushed and groomed the droppings are nice sized and easy to clean up i just had him neutered 2 days ago and he ate this sojos mix with the same gusto even with the e collar to challenge him so i am a fan and we are finished with the second 2 5 lb bag and i just ordered another one hope this helps someone with a picky eater i know another reviewer mentioned their shih tzu not liking it but this shows you that dogs have certain tastes different from each other much like us humans\n",

      "Original Text: ok i just bought bisquick gf and the first thing i tried to make were the drop biscuits recipe listed on the box these are not the kind that are rolled out cut these are drop biscuits the results were very tasty the taste of this gf bisquick is very much like the original but the taste is not as tart as the original if you want a similar buttermilk taste you will need to use buttermilk instead of milk in the biscuit recipe i noticed something else that was odd and might be a problem for anyone new to cooking it seems that the amount of mix called for is not quite right i read the side of the box and it claims that there are 3 2 3 cups of mix in the box 11 servings of 1 3 cup each the biscuit recipe called for 2 cups of mix i measured heaping teaspoonfuls into a measuring cup and i do not even have a cup of mix left in the bag i know this mix does not have wheat flour and maybe that kind of flour measures differently maybe if i dug into the bag with a cup i would have used less but the recipe came out right so there must be a misprint on the box i am assuming i measured properly because i have biscuits that can be dipped in gravy smothered with butter jam or sliced to make those yummy mcdonald s breakfast sandwiches by following the instructions i have a lot of biscuits if you are single or just cooking for two you might want to cut the recipe in half you will still have plenty and you will not go through the box so quickly this mix cost me around 5 00 and i do not have enough left to make anything else without buying another box which i will because these biscuits are really really good still if you are watching your budget do not prepare more than you need br br about these biscuits yummy fairly golden because the recipe calls for eggs and they can be sliced with some crumbly edges just like glutenous ones without the eggs you probably will not get the nice eye appealing color even though they are drop biscuits you still have to cut in shortening or margarine if you do not have a cutter you will need to use a long fork that is more difficult so if you are a celiac that has been craving biscuits buy a cutter it will cost you as much as a box of this mix the biscuit recipe also calls for milk so if you want that nice tart taste that is reminiscent of the original bisquick you will need to use buttermilk br br the mix is made up of rice flour sugar leavening potato starch salt xanthum gum many mixes and goodies made with rice flour taste grainy bisquick has done a fantastic job with the rice flour it is not grainy at all i repeat it is not grainy at all for those of you new to celiac cooking using a starch such as corn potato or tapioca is normal and adds a lightness to the baked item that would not be possible with rice flour alone leavening is simply baking soda or powder and is necessary for rising the sugar and salt are for flavor and consistency and yes they are necessary as for the xanthum gum it is a perfectly natural ingredient and it gives celiac safe baked goods a bit of elasticity acting as a replacement for the gluten you will find xanthum gum in just about every baked goodie made for people with celiac disease can you just make your own mix and spend less money sure but you will have a very difficult time finding rice flour as finely ground as the rice flour that is the predominant and main ingredient in this mix br br the other recipes listed on the box are for pancakes waffles strawberry shortcakes pizza crust ultimate chicken fingers and oven baked chicken you can find more recipes on their website br br i recommend this product for the taste i do wish that more mix was in the box for the price\n",

      "Original Text: i switched my mini schauzers over to newman s own organics a month ago when they came off of their puppy chow i have been looking for a good quality dog food rated 4 stars by dogfoodadvisor com without going into debt purchasing it i was feeding them a different brand that was breed specific food but was having trouble trying to find it in stock anywhere a few places if they carried it at all only carried the very small bags 2 5 lbs and with two dogs one bag would last about 3 5 days plus these little 2 5 lb bags cost more than half what the larger 10 lb bag cost i tried to make an arrangement to have one of the places order the larger bag for me but they conveniently forgot to place the order so i was stuck purchasing the ridiculously more expensive small bags then i heard about newman s own organics which is rated a better dog food than the breed specific food i was using and cost less and then i discovered that i could buy this food at amazon com have it shipped on a regular basis to my home with no shipping costs and a discount on the food for signing up for the subscription plan delivery no brainer no more running out of food no more driving 50 miles or more to find it no more hassels br br and best and most importantly of all my little guys love it their stools firmed up almost immediately after starting the switchover they seem more active more alert more regular and they actually chew this food they inhaled their puppy chow without chewing i cannot say enough good things about both newman s own and amazon s subscription delivery service\n",

      "Original Text: let me start by saying my 7 month old son who is used to my home prepared baby foods loves this as a once in a blue moon convenience meal i have tried it and it tastes pretty good to me too rare in the baby food industry br br i am following a weaning guide that i used for my daughter and it makes you pretty wary of commercial baby foods as babies easily get used to the bland watery taste and sometimes take a lot of coaxing to go back to home made healthy meals resulting in picky toddlers and children my daughter is now 3 and has never refused a home cooked meal yet and i attribute that to the hard work i put in in the first year another problem with commercial baby foods is that they are usually so padded out with water that nutritional needs are not fully met during the day and babies can start waking in the night due to genuine hunger br br i would love to ask who came up with the magical 4oz measurement for all stage 2 baby food jars and packets though my son takes more like 6oz of my home prepared meals which are much fuller so i have had to add a little sweet potato to this to increase the volume and it does seem really quite runny and padded out with water so i add a teaspoon or 2 of rice cereal to thicken it up a little before long i am sure he will just be on 2 full 4oz jars when i give him this br br all that said i will reiterate it is really quite tasty for a commercial baby food and i have no problem giving it to my son once in a while i do recommend\n",

      "Original Text: this is a great food and my cat loves it the only thing that seems a bit strange to me is the difference in consistency between batches and even the difference in consistency between the 3 ounce cans and the 5 ounce cans seriously it looks like a different food with the 3 ounce cans looking much smoother in texture and the 5 ounce cans looking much more grainy i hope that the following review will help someone with a cat that has stomach issues similar to mine br br i have tried many many products aimed at helping with digestive upset for my cat her pain and suffering was so great that i thought i was going to have to put her to sleep i went to multiple vets and had thousands of dollars worth of diagnostics done to try and find out why she was having acid reflux crying and subsequently vomitting endoscopy xray ultrasound bloodwork etc one vet told me to just give her pepcid this worked for a while but then became completely ineffective after a while the same vet then told me that she probably just has food allergies and would have to be on steroids for the rest of her life and thats all that could be done and prescribed different kinds of science diet which we all know is actually a terrible food for cats with digestive problems br br well what do you know the steroids did not help at all i tried probiotics of various brands for pets i tried digestive enzymes i tried many different natural products designed to help ease digestive intestinal inflammation i tried a homiopathic vet the only one in my area and spent a few thousand more dollars rerunning tests and running other tests for pancreatitis etc i tried making her food from raw meat to try and eliminate food allergies to commericial foods as a potential problem etc i tried everything but still my cat was constantly licking her lips then crying in terrible pain and vomitting very consistently and now was losing interest in her food and was losing weight and starting to look boney i was determined to not give up on her though i had just lost my wife to infection during a failed bone marrow transplant cancer during all this and was not about to give up on my girl br br i stopped making her food and started getting her natures variety canned rabbit formula and the duck formula she loved the food but it did not seem to be helping her feel all that much better even though a lot of other people were having great success i then found a site called wellvet dot com that said that the ulcinex was very effective at repairing ulcers and the stomach lining in pets it also said that it was very effective at controlling vomitting that occurs a few hours after eating which is exactly what was consistently happening and no other product that i had found so far claimed to do same thing i was skeptical as soon as it started talking about chinese herbs and such but i figured it was worth a shot br br i started giving this as prescribed from wellvet along with georges aloe vera juice the one without preservatives and no taste which is said to help a lot for acid reflux sufferers i found a few people that said it worked great for their cats and continuing the rabbit duck formula all the while praying within a few days i started noticing a drastic improvement she was licking her lips less and was able to relax for longer periods of time without jumping up in pain and crying she vommitted once within a several day period several days later no more crying and instead of hiding behind the bedroom door licking her lips the whole night she started sleeping with me at night like she used to now several weeks later she is literally 90 better no more vomitting at all is in very little pain very little lip licking and only very occasionally at that she also gets much more rest and has put on several pounds and is back above her normal weight and has a nice chubby belly my cat suffered daily for 2 long years during this whole process before i found this and the other two mentioned products the aloe vera juice on its own did not seem to completely do the trick so i think its the combination of the three things that is really effective i only hope that no permanent damage has already been done but now i have my cat back and do not have to suffer through losing a great wife and a great cat if you have a cat with severe stomach issues you owe it to yourself and your cat to try this along with the georges aloe vera and ulcinex br br a href http www amazon com gp product b0006iicom metagenics ulcinex 90 tablets a br br a href http www amazon com gp product b000qv9ta0 warren laboratories george s aloe vera 64 fl oz liquid a\n",

      "Original Text: why is it so hard to find rabbit based cat food br br i like to give my cat variety in his diet his main foods are mostly poultry but i like to keep the fish and red meat to a minimum after my last cat was diagnosed with diabetes i did a lot of in depth research on feline diets one veterinarian who is written extensively about homemade cat foods was fond of using rabbit as a poultry alternative because it is closest to what a small cat would eat in the wild it is particularly excellent to supplement a diet when the cat is sensitive to fish as many are it is also higher in fat than fish many fish based foods i looked at only took 15 to 20 of their calories from fat and a cat needs more than that br br this food fits the bill it is got an excellent ingredient list it is grain free which is what i consider to be the most important qualification and does not contain animal meal or by products br br there are three reasons i am giving it four stars instead of five first it is expensive rabbit meat by weight is going to be pricey so i am not surprised but just because i think it is worth the price does not mean i would not like to pay less second my cat is not crazy about it it is got a ground texture and he is very fussy about only eating shredded meat i solved this by mixing a 3 oz can of this food with a 3 oz can of shredded chicken of a different brand and he gobbled it up i just wish i did not have to take that extra step finally it is awfully dry it was actually a surprise the meat itself is very dry and the liquid in the can is totally separated i think most cat foods use thickeners so that the gravy clings to the meat and this one does not since one of the many advantages of canned food is that it helps to keep the cat hydrated they have a low thirst drive and are built to take in much of their fluids with their food i was a bit disappointed and surprised the first time i tipped what looked like a can full of meat too far to the side and ended up with watery cat food juice on my hand and the kitchen floor but this was also solved by mixing it with a chicken in gravy food br br those complaints are not enough to keep me from buying this food though it is still a great cat food with a hard to find protein source and a good ingredient list it is a bit expensive for me to use as a main food but a can or two a week gives just the right amount of variety\n",
